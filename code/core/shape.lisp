;;; A shape of rank D is the Cartesian product of D ranges.  That means
;;; each element of a shape is a D-tuple of integers, such that the first
;;; integer is an element of the first range, the second integer is an
;;; element of the second range and so on.  If any of the ranges of a shape
;;; is empty, that shape is the empty shape.  The empty shape must not be
;;; confused with the shape that is the product of zero ranges, which has a
;;; size of one.
