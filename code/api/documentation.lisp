(document-function reshape
  "Returns a lazy array with the contents of ARRAY, but after applying the
supplied MODIFIERS in left-to-right order.  A modifier must either be a
shape, or a transformation.

A shape can denote one of three different modifications, depending on
whether it is larger than the array, smaller than the array, or has the
same number of elements as the array.  If the shape is larger than the
array, it denotes a broadcasting operation.  If the shape is smaller than
the array, it denotes a selection of a sub-array.  If the shape has the
same number of elements, it denotes a lexicographic reordering operation.

In case the modifier is a transformation, the new array is obtained by
taking each index and corresponding value of the original array and
applying the transformation to the index while retaining the value."
