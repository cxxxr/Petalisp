(document-function range
  "Returns a new, normalized range from the supplied parameters.

This function can be invoked with one, two or three integers.  If it is
called with a single argument, the result is a range starting from zero,
with step size one, up to but excluding the supplied argument.  In other
words, a single argument is treated just like one of the dimensions of a
regular array.  If the range constructor is called with two arguments, then
the result is still a range with a step size of one, but with the first
argument as the inclusive lower bound, and with the second argument as the
exclusive upper bound.  The three argument version behaves just like the
two argument version, except that the additional third argument denotes the
step size.  The sign of the step size gives the direction of the range: If
the sign is positive, then the exclusive upper bound must be larger than
the inclusive lower bound or the resulting range is empty.  If the sign is
negative, the first argument is used as an inclusive upper bound, and the
second argument is used as an exclusive lower bound.

It is worth mentioning that the range constructor has the exact same name
and semantics as the range constructor in the Python programming language."

The supplied function F must accept 2k arguments and return k values, where
k is the number of supplied arrays.  All supplied arrays must have the same
shape S, which is the cartesian product of some ranges, i.e., S = r_1 x
... r_n, where each range r_k is a set of integers, e.g., {0, 1, ..., m}.
Then Î² returns k arrays of shape s = r_2 x ... x r_n, whose elements are a
combination of the elements along the first axis of each array according to
the following rules:

1. If the given arrays are empty, return k empty arrays.

2. If the first axis of each given array contains exactly one element, drop
   that axis and return arrays with the same content, but with shape s.

3. If the first axis of each given array contains more than one element,
   partition the indices of this axis into a lower half l and an upper half
   u.  Then split each given array into a part with shape l x s and a part
   with shape u x s.  Recursively process the lower and the upper halves of
   each array independently to obtain 2k new arrays of shape s.  Finally,
   combine these 2k arrays element-wise with f to obtain k new arrays with

(document-function compute
  "The primary interface for evaluating lazy arrays.  It takes any number of
arguments that must be lazy arrays or objects that can be converted to lazy
arrays with the function LAZY-ARRAY --- and returns the same number of
possibly specialized regular arrays with the corresponding contents.  A
special case is that whenever an array with rank zero would be returned, it
instead returns the sole element of that array.  The reason for this
treatment of scalars is that Petalisp treats every object as an array,
whereas in Common Lisp the rank zero array containing an object and that
object are distinct entities.  Of those two distinct representations, the
non-array one is much more intuitive and useful in practice, so this is the
one being returned.

Whenever a shape of any of the supplied arrays is not a valid shape for a
regular array, that array is collapsed before being computed, i.e., each
axis is shifted to begin with zero, and divided by the step size.

All the heavy lifting in Petalisp happens within this function.  The exact
details of how it operates aren't important for application programmers,
but it is valuable to understand the rough steps that happen internally.
The individual steps it performs are:

1. Convert each supplied argument to a lazy array.

2. Collapse each lazy array whose shape isn't equivalent to that of a
   regular array.

3. Determine the dependency graph whose roots are the collapsed lazy
   arrays, and whose leaves are lazy arrays resulting from a call to
   LAZY-ARRAY on a regular array or scalar.

4. Optimize the dependency graph, discard all unused parts, and plan a
   schedule that is fast and has reasonable memory requirements.

5. Execute the schedule on the available hardware.  Make use of CPUs, GPUs,
   or even distributed systems where possible. Gather the results in the
   form of regular arrays.

6. Change the internal representation of all the originally supplied lazy
   arrays such that future calculations involving them directly use the
   computed results.

7. Return the results as multiple values, while replacing any array with
   rank zero with the single element contained in that array.

This function is the workhorse of Petalisp.  A lot of effort went into
making it not only powerful, but also extremely fast.  The overhead of
assembling a graph of lazy arrays and passing it to COMPUTE instead of
invoking an already compiled and optimized imperative program is usually on
the order of just a few microseconds."
