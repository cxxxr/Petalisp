(document-type range
  "A range denotes a possibly empty set of integers.")

(document-type empty-range
  "An empty range is a range with zero elements.")

(document-type non-empty-range
  "A non-empty range denotes a set of integers, starting from a lower bound START,
by a fixed stride STEP, to an exclusive upper bound END.")

(document-function range
  "Returns a new, normalized range from the supplied parameters.

This function can be invoked with one, two or three integers.  If it is
called with a single argument, the result is a range starting from zero,
with step size one, up to but excluding the supplied argument.  In other
words, a single argument is treated just like one of the dimensions of a
regular array.  If the range constructor is called with two arguments, then
the result is still a range with a step size of one, but with the first
argument as the inclusive lower bound, and with the second argument as the
exclusive upper bound.  The three argument version behaves just like the
two argument version, except that the additional third argument denotes the
step size.  The sign of the step size gives the direction of the range: If
the sign is positive, then the exclusive upper bound must be larger than
the inclusive lower bound or the resulting range is empty.  If the sign is
negative, the first argument is used as an inclusive upper bound, and the
second argument is used as an exclusive lower bound.

It is worth mentioning that the range constructor has the exact same name
and semantics as the range constructor in the Python programming language."

depending on whether the shape modifier has fewer, equal, or more elements
than the current lazy array, functions, that are applied to the shape of
the current lazy array to obtain additional modifiers, and integers that
can restrict the operation of any of the other modifiers to just the first
few axes while leaving the remaining axes as they are.

More precisely, the processing maintains a lazy array L of rank R that is
initialized to the result of applying LAZY-ARRAY constructor to the
supplied first argument, and a shape S with rank P that initialized to the
shape of L, and updates L and S for each modifier while maintaining the
invariant that P is less than or equal to R, and that the first P ranges of
the shape S are equal to the first P ranges of the lazy array L.  The rules
for updating L and S are as follows:

1. If the modifier is a non-negative integer N, set S to the shape
   consisting of the first N ranges of L.  Signal an error if N exceeds R.

2. If the modifier is an invertible transformation with input rank M and
   output rank N, extend the transformation with R minus M trailing
   identity mappings such that it has input rank R and output rank N plus R
   minus M.  Create a new lazy array by reordering L with that extended
   transformation.  Set L to the newly created lazy array, and set S to
   the first N ranges of the newly created lazy array.  Signal an error if
   M is larger than R.

3. If the modifier is a function, apply it to S to obtain a number of new
   modifiers.  Process all of the multiple values returned by this function
   application as if they were supplied instead of this function modifier.

4. If the modifier is a shape designator, compare the designated shape with
   S, and chose one of the following rules to update L and S such that the
   latter is equal to the designated one.

   a) If the modifier designates a shape with rank N that denotes a strict
      subset of S, create a new lazy array of rank R whose first N ranges
      are equal to those of the designated shape, whose trailing R minus N
      ranges are equal to the corresponding ones of L, and where each index
      maps to the same value as L.  Then, set L to that newly created lazy
      array and set S to the designated shape.  Signal an error unless N is
      equal to P.

   b) If the designated shape has rank N and the same number of elements as
      S, create a new lazy array with the same contents and the same
      lexicographical order as L, whose shape consists of the N ranges of
      the designated shape followed by the last R minus P ranges of L.  Set
      L to the newly created lazy array, and set S to the designated shape.

   c) If the designated shape has rank N and more elements than the current
      shape, create a new lazy array that is a broadcasting reference to L,
      whose shape consists of the N ranges of the designated shape followed
      by the last R minus P ranges of the current lazy array.  Set L to the
      newly created lazy array, and set S to the designated shape.

(document-function compute
  "The primary interface for evaluating lazy arrays.  It takes any number of
arguments that must be lazy arrays or objects that can be converted to lazy
arrays with the function LAZY-ARRAY --- and returns the same number of
possibly specialized regular arrays with the corresponding contents.  A
special case is that whenever an array with rank zero would be returned, it
instead returns the sole element of that array.  The reason for this
treatment of scalars is that Petalisp treats every object as an array,
whereas in Common Lisp the rank zero array containing an object and that
object are distinct entities.  Of those two distinct representations, the
non-array one is much more intuitive and useful in practice, so this is the
one being returned.

Whenever a shape of any of the supplied arrays is not a valid shape for a
regular array, that array is collapsed before being computed, i.e., each
axis is shifted to begin with zero, and divided by the step size.

All the heavy lifting in Petalisp happens within this function.  The exact
details of how it operates aren't important for application programmers,
but it is valuable to understand the rough steps that happen internally.
The individual steps it performs are:

1. Convert each supplied argument to a lazy array.

2. Collapse each lazy array whose shape isn't equivalent to that of a
   regular array.

3. Determine the dependency graph whose roots are the collapsed lazy
   arrays, and whose leaves are lazy arrays resulting from a call to
   LAZY-ARRAY on a regular array or scalar.

4. Optimize the dependency graph, discard all unused parts, and plan a
   schedule that is fast and has reasonable memory requirements.

5. Execute the schedule on the available hardware.  Make use of all
   processing units, accelerators, or even distributed systems where
   possible. Gather the results in the form of regular arrays.

6. Change the internal representation of all the originally supplied lazy
   arrays such that future calculations involving them directly use the
   computed results.

7. Return the results as multiple values, while replacing any array with
   rank zero with the single element contained in that array.

This function is the workhorse of Petalisp.  A lot of effort went into
making it not only powerful, but also extremely fast.  The overhead of
assembling a graph of lazy arrays and passing it to COMPUTE instead of
invoking an already compiled and optimized imperative program is usually on
the order of just a few microseconds."
